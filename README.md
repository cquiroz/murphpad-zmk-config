# MurphPad ZMK Config

## Instructions

1. You will need to [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), and [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) so you can edit it.
2. Navigate to the **Actions** tab and click the "I understand my workflows, go ahead and run them" button to enable builds.

3. Edit [config/murphpad.conf](config/murphpad.conf) to enable/disable features. Edit [config/murphpad.keymap](config/murphpad.keymap) to change the keymap. Lastly, make sure the [build.yaml](build.yaml) file has your board in the "boards" list.
4. After committing your changes, your firmware will begin compiling. Assuming there are no typos or other problems, it will eventually be [downloadable from the Actions tab](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#installing-the-firmware).
5. [Flash the firmware](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#flashing-uf2-files) that matches the board you're using, e.g. `murphpad-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` for a nice!nano v2.

## Common Questions/Problems

### There was an error and the build didn't finish.

#### There is probably an error in your keymap.

Carefully double-check the last changes you made. ZMK syntax is very different from QMK syntax. Note that when editing keymaps, each ZMK code is generally preceded by a reference categorizing what that code does.

For example: the letter "Z" is categorized as a **k**ey **p**ress. To add the letter "Z" to a keymap, it must be written `&kp Z`.

A few more examples below:

| QMK | ZMK |
| --- | --- |
| `KC_A` | `&kp A` |
| `QK_REBOOT` | `&sys_reset` |
| `LT(1, KC_SPACE)` | `&lt 1 SPACE` |

There are many, many more differences. Don't forget to [check the ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/keymaps).

### The OLED/RGB/encoder(s) don't work.

#### Double-check the features in the [config/murphpad.conf](config/murphpad.conf) file.

And double-check the Kconfig file in the build results to make sure what you've enabled is really enabled. As of mid-July 2022, [there are also some issues regarding default board/shield configurations taking precedence over user configurations](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/1382).

#### The OLED can be a bit finicky.

[There is a known issue with OLEDs not being re-initialized after power off](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/674); please check that pull request for any updates and/or possible workarounds.

Try the following:

1. Wait at least one minute and press the physical reset button on the board once.
2. If `CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_EXT_POWER=y` is set in [config/murphpad.conf](config/murphpad.conf), turn on RGB. Then try step 1.
3. Add `&ext_power EP_ON` to [your keymap](config/murphpad.keymap) and press the key to *make sure* external power is on. Then try step 2.

### How can I turn off the RGB without turning the OLED off?

Since the RGB LEDs and the OLED are powered by the same pin (`VCC`), both will be turned off if power is cut to that pin. There are two ways to resolve this:

#### Set `CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW_EXT_POWER=n` in [config/murphpad.conf](config/murphpad.conf).

This configuration setting will allow you to turn the RGB LEDs off without cutting power. It is the default in this repository.

:warning: Not cutting power to the LEDs will have a significant impact on battery life. Check the [ZMK Power Profiler](https://zmk.dev/power-profiler) and set your expectations accordingly.

#### Connect OLED VCC to a different power source.

If the board powering your MurphPad has an alternate power pin (often labeled `RAW`), connecting `VCC` on the OLED to it will prevent the display from being affected when board `VCC` is toggled off.

Later revisions of the MurphPad add jumpers to simplify this process for boards with alternate power pins [in the same place as nice!nano `RAW`](https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-nano/pinout-schematic), but this can be done on all known versions.

:warning: If using a nice!nano v2 without a battery, its `RAW` pin does not always deliver consistent voltage. This can result in the OLED turning off immediately after boot, or failing to turn on. Unfortunately, the only guaranteed fix is to add a battery; occasionally it will work after a reset [as described in step 1](#the-oled-can-be-a-bit-finicky).

1. Disconnect OLED `VCC` from LED8 by cutting the trace on the PCB.
2. Solder a wire connecting from the `RAW` pin on the PCB to the OLED `VCC` pin.
   - [@tokolist](https://github.com/tokolist) demonstrates an elegant solution by wiring `RAW` to the unused LED strip connection, but the wire can be connected directly.

:warning: If the LED strip is in use, you will also need to cut the trace between its `5V` and OLED `VCC`, and rewire the strip to board `VCC`.

1. Disconnect OLED `VCC` from LED8 by cutting the J1 jumper.
2. Connect OLED `VCC` to board `RAW` by closing the J2 jumper.

:warning: If your board's additional power pin is not in the same place, you will need to wire that yourself instead of closing J2.

### After disconnecting the MurphPad from Bluetooth, it won't reconnect.

#### Forget the Bluetooth connection on both the MurphPad and the device, then try re-pairing.

If you don't remember which profile on the MurphPad was used to connect to a specific device, this may mean cycling through each (`&bt BT_PRV`/`&bt BT_NXT`) and clearing them (`&bt BT_CLR`) one by one. [See ZMK's documentation for more info](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/bluetooth#bluetooth-pairing-and-profiles).

As a last resort, try flashing the `settings_reset` firmware for your board; this will force-clear everything.
